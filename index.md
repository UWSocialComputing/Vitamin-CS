# Look Club

**Look Club** is a social platform that allows users to watch TV shows asynchronously on a schedule and chat about them with others.

Here's how someone might use it:
1. Specify what you want to watch, and how often. We'll match you with others who want to do the same!
2. In your newly formed group, schedule a day of the week and an episode to watch up to together.
3. Discuss your thoughts and reactions to that week's watching! Don't worry about spoilers, we automatically block potentially risky messages.
