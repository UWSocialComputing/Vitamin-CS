# Look Club

**Look Club** is a social platform that allows users to watch TV shows asynchronously on a schedule and chat about them with others. You can watch **new shows** while making **new friends**.

Here's how someone might use it:
1. Specify what you want to watch, and how often. We'll match you with others who want to do the same!
2. In your newly formed group, schedule a day of the week and an episode to watch up to together.
3. Discuss your thoughts and reactions to that week's watching! Don't worry about spoilers, we automatically block potentially risky messages.

Already have people to talk about your favorite shows with? Perfect--you can still use *Look Club* and invite them to your group!

# Our Development Process
Look Club was built as a part of [UW's Social Computing Capstone](https://social.cs.washington.edu/cse481social/). Make sure to check out the other projects made in the course!

We documented our entire process on this website through blog posts. We started with doing [user research](/Vitamin-CS/2022/01/20/research-post.html) to identify needs within our problem space, [pitched our initial idea](/Vitamin-CS/2022/01/25/initial-pitch.html) of what we were doing, made a [low fidelity prototype](/Vitamin-CS/2022/02/03/low-fidelity-prototype.html) to test with users, designed our [project architecture](/Vitamin-CS/2022/02/10/Code-Design-And-Specification.html) based on identified requirements, [pitched the more concrete version](/Vitamin-CS/2022/02/15/advanced-pitch.html) of *Look Club*, tested a [medium fidelity prototype](/Vitamin-CS/2022/02/24/user-testing.html) with users, and ended up with our [final prototype](/Vitamin-CS/2022/03/03/digital-prototype.html). Check out our posts for each of these to learn more about our process and how *Look Club* evolved over the ~10 weeks that we worked on it!
