Look club is a social platform that allows users to watch TV shows asynchronously on a schedule and chat about them with others. Here's how it works:

### STEP 1: MATCH
Specify what you want to watch, and how often. We'll match you with others who want to do the same!
### STEP 2: SCHEDULE
Schedule a day of the week and an episode to watch up to as a group.
### STEP 3: AVOID SPOILERS

### STEP 4: DISCUSS

# Meet the Team
## William Castro

## Elijah Greisz

## Shaurya Jain

## Logan Wang

# Demo Video

# Final Prototype
