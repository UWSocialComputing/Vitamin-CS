# Look Club

![Look Club Banner](/Vitamin-CS/images/Banner.png)

Look club is a social platform that allows users to watch TV shows asynchronously on a schedule and chat about them with others. Here's how it works:

### STEP 1
Specify what you want to watch, and how often. We'll match you with others who want to do the same!
### STEP 2
In your newly formed group, schedule a day of the week and an episode to watch up to together.
### STEP 3
Discuss your thoughts and reactions to that week's watching! Don't worry about spoilers, we automatically block potentially risky messages.
